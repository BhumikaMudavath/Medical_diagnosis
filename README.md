# Medical_diagnosis
## OVERVIEW
This project is a medical diagnosis web application built using Streamlit. It uses machine learning models to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on user-provided symptoms or medical parameters. The app offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with the model and receive quick predictions.
## FEATURES
-  Predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease) based on input parameters.  
-  User-friendly interface with Streamlit.  
-  Utilizes pre-trained machine learning models saved in .sav format.  
-  web-based deployment for easy accessibility.
## Technologies Used
-  Python  
-  Streamlit  
-  Scikit-learn  
-  Pickle (for model serialization)
-  streamlit_option_menu  
## deployment
The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud.
